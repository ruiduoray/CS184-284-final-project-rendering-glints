	<h1 align="middle">Final Project: Rendering Glints for Path Tracer</h1>
		<h2 align="middle">Proposal</h2>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				Our Project aims to add texture supports and mipmapping to our existing path tracer projects. Then, we will add glint effects by using high resolution normal maps.

			<h3>Problem Description</h3>
			<p>
				For complex specular surfaces under sharp point lighting, it is impractical to use Monte Carlo pixel sampling to render them, because energy is concentrated on tiny highlights. The problem is important because we would like to render more realistic images. Therefore, we plan to use a method which calculates on the true distribution of normals on a surface patch to solve this problem. 
			</p>

			<h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>	
			<p>We would like to be able to render glints on complex specular surfaces just like the real world. We should be able to deliver glinty appearance in still images.
			</p> 

			<h3>Schedule</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Week 1: Collecting information and refactoring the code
					</li>
					<li>
						Week 2: Implementing major functionalities
					</li>
					<li>
						Week 3: Testing and Fixing
					</li>
					<li>
						Week 4: Rendering results and Documentation
					</li>
				</ul>
			
			</p>

			<h3>Resources </h3>
			<p>We will use the path tracer from previous assignments as our framework. </p>
